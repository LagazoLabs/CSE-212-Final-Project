# Binary Search Trees

## Introduction
Binary Search Trees are a complex structure of data. A Binary Search Tree, much like the name implies, structures data into a *tree* like format. Binary Search Trees sort data based off their value. An easy way to have a better understanding of it is if you compare it to family trees.

As you can see, the **Child** is linked to two **Parents**, and where as the **Parents** will be linked to **Grandparents**. In terms of Binary Search Trees, **nodes** of data are connected to other parts of data. The **Parent Node**, which is the primary node that will be used to sort the data and connect to what are known as **Sub-Trees** or for a better understanding, **Child-Trees**. Data that is smaller than the **Parent Tree** is sorted to the left **Child Tree**, while data larger than the **Parent Tree** will be sorted to the right **Child Tree**.
