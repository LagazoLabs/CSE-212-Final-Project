# Binary Search Trees

## Introduction
Binary Search Trees are a complex structure of data. A Binary Search Tree, much like the name implies, structures data into a *tree* like format. Binary Search Trees sort data based off their value. It is like a family tree in a way, where a **node** of data is connected to other parts of data. The **Parent Node**, which is the primary node that will be used to sort the data and connect to what are known as **Sub-Trees** or **Child-Trees**. Data that is smaller will often be on the left and right if larger.
