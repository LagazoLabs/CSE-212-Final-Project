When you write each of the data structure modules, you will want to consider the following questions (this is not an exhaustive list):

- What is the purpose of the data structure?
- What is the performance of the data structure (you will need to talk about big O notation)?
- What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?
- How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?
- What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?
